A summarization of my learnings from working with the new way of working with data - Search Driven Analytics

### Executive summary:
Thoughtspot is a great tool for any organizations where the employees might need quick answers to many questions (i.e. all organizations). Then analysts won't have to answer short, day to day questions, but rather focus on things that bring greater value to the organization. After using it for a while, I must say that I'm impressed. There is still room for improvement, but considering the short time it's been at the market it is very capable already. 

### Benefits:
- Slimmed design and interface
- Quickly get answer to any question that anyone in the organization might have
- It's very easy to get started and use (once the system is in place). 
- The system supports a fantastic way to get help asking questions you didn't even know you had. Detecting outliers and any other interesting data 
- Amazing performance and speed in responses

### Limitations:
- Cannot create flexible visualizations
- A pretty high barrier to entry. Compared to Power BI for example, in which you can just add an excel or csv. To be useful a bigger batch of data need to be loaded(Yes, you can add data to Thoughtspot too, but it's not as easy). 
- Requires a dedicated server with high low end capacity. No easy way of integrating towards current cloud AD's.
